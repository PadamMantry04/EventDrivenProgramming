# Workflow of Kafka Producer-Consumer Implementation:

## Producer (Webhook):

- The Producer sets up an HTTP route to act as a webhook.
- It actively listens for incoming HTTP POST requests with message data.
- Upon receiving a message, the Producer sends the data to a Kafka topic using Kafka's API.

## Kafka Broker:

- Kafka brokers receive messages from Producers and store them in topics.
- Each topic can have multiple partitions for scalability and parallel processing.
- Messages are stored sequentially and remain in the topic for a configurable retention period.

## Consumer:

- The Consumer subscribes to the same Kafka topic.
- It pulls messages from the topic in real-time and processes them (e.g., logs or stores them in a database).
- The Consumer acknowledges successful processing to ensure reliable delivery.

## Key Benefits of This Workflow:

- Decoupling: Producers and Consumers operate independently, enhancing system modularity.
- Scalability: Multiple Producers and Consumers can work simultaneously.
- Reliability: Kafka ensures message delivery with replication and retention policies.
- This setup is ideal for real-time processing scenarios like logging, event handling, or analytics pipelines.
